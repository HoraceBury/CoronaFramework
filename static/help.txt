This application is a demonstration of the controls and libraries built over years for use with the Corona SDK framework.

To see how to use a particular library or control open it's related scene or just browser the code in this repository.

The code here is for anyone to use in any way they see fit with the condition that anyone doing so accepts that this is an ongoing development and at no time is considered complete.

No guarantees are made and anyone using this code must consider it as flawed as it's creator and as buggy as the next.

That said, please enjoy using these libraries. I hope they are at least useful or educational and help to build something better, more easily that without.
