This application will not teach you karate.

It is a practice aid primarily to set a pace for your kihon, kata or kihon kumite practice.

You choose the length of training, pace and whether breaks are included.

The app takes the place of the sensei's instruction.

Set the timer or generate a plan for your available practice time based on your personal experience.
